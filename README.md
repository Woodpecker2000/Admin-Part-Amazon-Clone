# Chat with Meta's LLaMA models at home made easy

This repository is a chat example with [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models running on a typical home PC. You will just need a NVIDIA videocard and some RAM to chat with model.

This repo is heavily based on Meta's original repo: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama

And on Steve Manuatu's repo: https://github.com/venuatu/llama

And on Shawn Presser's repo: https://github.com/shawwn/llama
