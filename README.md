# Chat with Meta's LLaMA models at home made easy

This repository is a chat example with [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models running on a typical home PC. You will just need a NVIDIA videocard and some RAM to chat with model.

This repo is heavily based on Meta's original repo: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama

And on Steve Manuatu's repo: https://github.com/venuatu/llama

And on Shawn Presser's repo: https://github.com/shawwn/llama

### System requirements
- Modern enough CPU
- NVIDIA graphics card
- 64 or better 128 Gb of RAM (192 or 256 would be perfect)

One may run with 32 Gb of RAM, but inference will be slow (with the speed of your swap file reading)
